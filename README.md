# Cloud Force Sky Challenge
The challenge involves creating a Cloud Formation template that provisions a VPC along with its essential components and an EC2 instance within the VPC and in a public subnet.
The template hence provisions an AWS VPC, two subnets (public and private), an internet gateway attached to the VPC, public route table associated with public subnet, security group, a rsa keypair, and an EC2 in the public subnet.
